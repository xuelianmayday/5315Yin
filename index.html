      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a software containerization platform. It performs operating system level virtulization - containerization. Docker is developed mainly for Linux, and uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel and a file system to enable independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, which prevents the overhead of maintaining virtual machines. </br>
